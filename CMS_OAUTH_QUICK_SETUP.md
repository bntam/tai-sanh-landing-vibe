## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

The following files have been updated for you:

### `public/admin/config.yml`
```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: bntam/tai-sanh-landing-vibe
  branch: main
  base_url: https://api.netlify.com
  auth_endpoint: auth

local_backend: true  # For local development
```

### `public/admin/index.html`
- Removed Netlify Identity widget script
- Now uses GitHub OAuth instead

---

## üîß Local Development

To test the CMS locally without authentication:

1. **Run the local backend server:**
   ```bash
   npx decap-server
   ```

2. **In another terminal, run your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the CMS:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:4321/admin`
   - Click "Login with Local Backend"
   - No authentication needed!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Check that environment variables are set correctly in Cloudflare Pages
- Verify the callback URL is exactly: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`
- Make sure you've deployed the latest changes

### "Cannot read repository"
- Verify your GitHub account has access to the repository
- Check that the repository name in `config.yml` is correct: `bntam/tai-sanh-landing-vibe`

### "Local backend not working"
- Make sure `npx decap-server` is running in a separate terminal
- Check that you're accessing `http://localhost:4321/admin` (not the production URL)
